# REam

Huge Shout Out to https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-build-a-discord-bot-with-node-js as I had no clue what I was doing honestly.

This is going to be used in my discord server for the game dREam I am working on.

I get that it is not finished or even close to it but I just wanted to get something out so I had a base to work with.
